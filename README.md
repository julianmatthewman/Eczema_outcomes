# Eczema outcomes

View the project website [here](https://julianmatthewman.github.io/Eczema_outcomes/).

Data management and analysis are organised using a [targets](https://github.com/ropensci/targets) pipeline. All steps are defined in the `_targets.R` file, additional functions can be found in the `/R` folder.

Reporting is organised using [workflowr](https://github.com/workflowr/workflowr) R markdown documents (in [`/analysis`](/analysis)) that render to HTML documents (in [`/docs`](/docs))
